# Apa Itu Tenur Air?

[NEEDS_TRANSLATION]

A working definition of [[apa-itu-tenur-air]] is “(t)he relationship, whether legally or customarily defined, between people, as individuals or groups, with respect to water resources”.6 In other words, watertenure arrangements determine how people, communities and organizations can access and use waterresources (water in streams, rivers, lakes and other surface water bodies as well as underground waterin aquifers) on the basis of rules, rights, custom, practices and procedures (hereafter described as ‘arrangements’). water tenure is a complex topic.7 First of all, there is the nature of the resource itself: fluid, fugitive, in constant motion in accordance with the water cycle. Unlike land which is immobileand can be relatively easily measured, measuring both the availability and use of water resources is afar more challenging task. Second, there is the fact of its renewability, and re-usability: the same watermay serve multiple uses as it flows downstream to the sea. Moreover, the issue of water quality isincreasingly problematic around the world. Poor water quality can be just as much a threat to watersecurity (in that polluted water may be dangerous to use) as any quantitative constraint. At the sametime, for non-consumptive uses such as livelihoods/inland fisheries, the flow of water in a watercoursecan be as important as the volume. Diversity of water tenure arrangements A further layer of complexity is introduced by the sheer diversity of water tenure arrangements thatmay co-exist within the same geographical area. Many types of water tenure arrangement are established based on the formal law of the countryconcerned. Often described in terms of ‘water rights’, they are typically created on the basis of permits, licenses, concessions or bulk water supply contracts or derive from legal powers conferred on publicbodies or from membership in a water user association or from other legal rules. For example, waterlaws often allow the ‘free’ small-scale use of both surface and ground water resources to meet basicneeds without the need for any administrative formalities. In some countries water rights still derivefrom land tenure rights or arise on the basis of historic use. Over recent years a number of countrieshave sought to promote private sector investment in land and other natural resources on the basis ofinvestment contracts protected under international law that also seek to confer ‘water rights’ upon theinvestor. However, other types of water tenure arrangements do not derive from formal law. These include long-standing arrangements based on customary or local law, as well as religious law, and a range of informalarrangements, some of which are simply illegal (sometimes called ‘water theft’), some of which aretolerated by the public agency responsible for water resources management (hereafter the ‘wateradministration’) and others which may exist because water laws are not fully implemented or enforcedor which arise on the basis of misunderstandings or gaps in the legal framework. Moreover, in somecountries customary, informal, or religious water tenure arrangements may also be recognized (andprotected) by formal law. A further important distinction must be made between water tenure arrangements that involve theabstraction and subsequent use of water resources8 (for water supply, irrigation or industrial purpose 6 FAO (2016). 7 A glossary is attached as Annex A. water tenure Assessment Guide – Version for Validation – Please do not citefor example) and those ‘non-consumptive’ uses of water resources (for inland fisheries and otherecosystem services or for hydropower) that do not involve the abstraction of water from a water body. The bundle of rights A further level of complexity can arise from the nature of water tenure arrangements themselves. Rights, for example, are never absolute. Particularly as regards tenure arrangements that involve rightsheld in common, including rights held by communities on the basis of customary law, the basic right touse water is accompanied with a bundle of, interconnected entitlements, such as the right toparticipate in decision making, the right to be consulted, the right to manage and develop water or toshare or transfer water use between users as well as rights relating to the management of conflicts.9 Moreover, formal water rights are typically accompanied by a number of obligations such as theobligation to measure the volume of water used and/or to treat wastewater prior to discharge backinto a watercourse. Why water tenure is important Considering the impacts of climate change and continued population growth, demand for water andwater resources is projected to increase10. With around two billion people currently living in areas ofwater scarcity, and with increased competition for water resources, the issue of water tenure, andmore specifically water tenure security has never been more important.11 Weak and insecure water tenure arrangements can lead to conflict. They can also constrain economicgrowth: people without secure water tenure are usually less likely to invest in developing waterresources. Weak and insecure water tenure arrangements can also threaten the very livelihoods ofthose who depend directly upon water resources for inland fishing, agriculture and ecosystem services. water tenure
