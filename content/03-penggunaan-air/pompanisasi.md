Some of these norms have been practiced for a very long time, some emerged due to state intervention, both during colonial times or as a result of the new order ERP project. These local customs and norms exist alongside the positive law, as such; they could sometimes also overlap with each other. Some of the practices may have diminished, some are still accepted as the *de facto* living law. Note that not all of these customary water use, especially those relating to water bodies may not be recognized as “customary water law” under the Water Law. This is because in order for customary rules to be officially recognized by the law, three cumulative prerequisites has to be met157: (a) traditional society, (b) territoriality – specific claim to land (c) the relationship between community and their lands, including the utilization of the *Ulayat* land, management and control as valid and complied by the community. As we can see below, the requirements under the Water Law above, especially (b) and (c) may not be fulfilled in the case of Kahayan. The territorial claim, as noted by van Dijk, “…*is always juslified by some ideological, moral, légal or political reason, which is not ecological, but is based on thé perception of the people of their ecological and socio-political conditions*”158 which may not be present in the case of Kahayan as the default rule on the water bodies are considered “open access”.159 Thus, the requirement of a specific claim to an area (water bodies) as required by the law, is not present. On the other hand, we can probably argue that in determining the recognition on customary [[apa-itu-tenur-air]], the water law may be “biased” towards customary land tenure. 157 Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 17 Tahun 2019 Tentang Sumber Daya Air.

Note that some people may argue that elucidation may not be binding as the actual clause, as they only provide explanation 158 Han van Dijk, ‘Land Tenure, Territoriality and Ecological Instability: A Sahelian Case Study’ \[1996\] The role of law in natural resource management, 17 \- 45 (1996). 159 Zulkifli B Lubis, *Social Mapping of Access to Peat Swamp Forest and Peatland Resources* (Indonesia-Australia Forest Carbon Partnership 2013). 1. Peatland as “Open Access” or “Common Property”? **Diagram 2: *Dayak Ngaju* Landscape Typology** (Source: Developed from Lubis, et.al. (2013) Alluvial land usually extend 2-5 km back from the banks of large rivers, which is then used for building settlements as well as cultivating food, crops and rubber.160 Beyond such alluvial land are peatlands, which is usually not used for agriculture but provides resources and nutrition. According to Lubis, the basic norm governing peatland is “common property” or “open access”, “…*without no particular customary law governing the resources*…”, except for *tatas* (more on this below).161 Meanwhile, Satia and Mahin suggests that main rivers, open swamps and closed swamps are considered common property whereas *saka* (third order tributaries) and *tatas* are considered private property. Lubis, however, does not categorize *saka* as private property.162 Further, Satia .et.al. also notes that Sungei (tributaries – medium sized river) can also be subjected to private property, which, according to the rules of *Kademangan*163 can be inherited but cannot be transferred.164 As to how claims can be made on peatland, anyone can claim the right over land if it has been worked (“hand print”), as evidenced by crop or other proof of 160 ibid. 161 ibid. Lubis also disagrees with claims raised by some activist that Dayak Ngaju has a concept of “customary territory” or “communal land”. He argued that Dayak Ngaju’s relation to their land is more of “tenure” or property. 162 ibid. He notes that many *saka*are not branches of Sungai 163 Customary rules which are recognized by the province (but not necessarily by national legal system) 164 Satia and others (n 154).The authors provide example of Sungai Bakung which existed in the Sebangau National Park, which are managed by Jumadi, the offspring of Ongko Surung Mantir development.165 Peatland which have been developed can be claimed, but those which have not been developed are common property and open access.166 A person may mark its territory on specific water body by constructing *pasah* or *pondok*. If such building can be found then, according to Satia,
